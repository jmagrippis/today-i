Today I started a blog with Gatsby!

I've first tried Gatsby a couple years back and it was already a force to be reckoned... it has only risen in popularity since!

The most effective way for me to learn something, is to built something with it.

Use my own pictures as the post covers. Unsplash is great and I've been using it in all professional projects, but why not dogfood your own stuff?

What am I doing wrong? Check out the [source code], and let me know üòÅ

Template literals?

`kebab-case` for component names?!
