> I'm not the best photographer at Triptease; I'm not even the best photographer in my team!

That's how I started my talk today, and it's totally true; even so, I take photos and so do **you**! And it's no secret I love explaining things, so I put together this presentation to demystify how cameras capture light. The goal was to help my fellow colleagues understand how tweaking the three base variables of **aperture**, **shutter speed** and **ISO rating** affects how much light is captured, and how each variable affects the look of a photo.

## Sharing Lunch?

Every Friday, my company orders free food for everyone in the London office, and one of us gets to go on stage and talk about something they're passionate about. It's a common ritual in startups and we call it "Sharing Lunch", although it seems most other companies go with "Lunch & Learn".

It's a ritual I love, and I always encourage colleagues to take advantage and present their stories, oddities and passions!

I've done a few myself over the three years I've been at Triptease, trying to keep the ratio of "product/tech for nerds" versus "fun for everyone" talks at around 50%. This was the first "fun" one where the vast majority of the photos were taken by yours truly, and I couldn't be happier!

## How did it go?

Well! My colleagues are too kind to tell me otherwise, but from their faces and reactions during the presentation, as well as reading between the lines when gathering feedback after, I do believe I put on a good show.
